## Using the Web App
A user is expected to key in a latitude and Longitude value and clicks a button to get weather updates for the place whose cordinates are entered.

### How IT works
The application consumes a weather API using core javascript and updates html elements with the respective current weather as well as a 6 a.m to 6p.m hourly weather forecast.
